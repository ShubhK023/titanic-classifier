This project explores the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using logistic regression. After initial data exploration and preprocessing, including handling missing values and converting categorical features, we trained a model achieving 79% accuracy. The analysis includes visualizations and a confusion matrix for model evaluation.

Detailed Overview:

This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival based on various features like age, gender, fare, and class. We began with exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing survival rates across different categories using seaborn's countplot. Key insights included higher survival rates among females and first-class passengers.

Next, we cleaned the data by handling missing values in age and embarked port, and converting categorical variables (e.g., gender, embarked port) into numerical format suitable for machine learning. After preprocessing, we split the data into training and testing sets and trained a logistic regression model. Initially encountering convergence warnings, we adjusted model parameters and achieved a final accuracy of 79%.

Evaluation involved using a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance in predicting survival outcomes. This provided a detailed understanding of the model's strengths and areas for improvement. Overall, this project serves as a practical demonstration of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation techniques for predicting survival outcomes using machine learning.
